# Vue.js Reactivity System Demonstration

This project demonstrates the core concepts of the **Vue.js reactivity system** using **Node.js (v22)** and **TypeScript (v5.6.3)**. It aims to give an understanding of how Vueâ€™s reactivity works under the hood, using simple and clear examples.

## Overview

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. One of its key features is its **reactivity system**, which ensures that the view (UI) stays in sync with the underlying data. This package demonstrates how the Vue.js reactivity system works, showing how changes to data automatically trigger updates to the view.

This demonstration package is built with:
- **Node.js v22** for the environment.
- **TypeScript v5.6.3** for static typing and code quality.
- **Vue.js** concepts, such as `reactive`, `ref`, and `computed` functions, but not using the Vue.js library directly. Instead, the focus is on replicating Vue's reactivity system logic.
